# The CODA-19 project

## Introduction

COVID-19 is a highly contagious acute respiratory illness that has undergone rapid global spread in the beginning of 2020. It is a major national public health threat that has disproportionately affected vulnerable Canadians, such as immunocompromised patients, older patients, and those living in long-term care facilities. There is a pressing need to develop predictive models in large patient cohorts to enable early diagnosis of COVID-19, adapt management strategies to individual risk profiles, identify early warning signs for clinical deterioration, forecast resource usage, and optimize health system organization. Scalable data sharing and distributed analysis infrastructures are urgently needed to enable the development and clinical validation of robust predictive models across multiple sites, and translate models into impactful decision support tools.

In collaboration with 9 hospital sites at the Canadian epicenter of the pandemic, the CODA-19 project is building a large repository of anonymized, multi-modality data from patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. CODA-19 will be used to develop and prospectively validate epidemiological and machine learning prediction models, both supervised and unsupervised, answering 4 key clinical needs: 

* achieving early diagnostic risk stratification, in order to improve early patient triage, and reduce nosocomial transmission
* understanding how distinct clinical phenotypes respond to alternative treatments, to provide individualized risk assessment and management
* identifying early warning signs that herald clinical deterioration, to enable proactive monitoring and treatment
* forecasting resource usage, to optimize health system resource use.
