# The CODA-19 project

## Introduction

In collaboration with 9 hospital sites at the Canadian epicenter of the pandemic, the CODA-19 project is building a large repository of anonymized, multi-modality data from patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. CODA-19 will be used to develop and prospectively validate epidemiological and machine learning prediction models, both supervised and unsupervised, answering 4 key clinical needs: 

* achieving early diagnostic risk stratification, in order to improve early patient triage, and reduce nosocomial transmission
* understanding how distinct clinical phenotypes respond to alternative treatments, to provide individualized risk assessment and management
* identifying early warning signs that herald clinical deterioration, to enable proactive monitoring and treatment
* forecasting resource usage, to optimize health system resource use.
